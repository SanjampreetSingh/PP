# LCM And GCD

[Link](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/lcm-and-gcd4516/1)

Given two numbers A and B. The task is to find out their LCM and GCD.

**Example 1:**  
`Input: A = 5 , B = 10`  
`Output: 10 5`  
**Explanation:**  
`LCM of 5 and 10 is 10, while their GCD is 5.`

**Example 2:**  
`Input: A = 14 , B = 8`  
`Output: 56 2`  
**Explanation:**  
`LCM of 14 and 8 is 56, while their GCD is 2.`

**Your Task:**  
`You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function lcmAndGcd() which takes an Integer N as input and returns a List of two Integers, the required LCM and GCD.`

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(log(min(A, B))  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

**Constraints:**

**Statistics**

1. Time complexity - O(log(min(A, B))
2. Space complexity - O(1)

**Result**:
