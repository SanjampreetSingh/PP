# Sum of Subarrays

[Link](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sum-of-subarrays2229/1)

Given an array A[] with N elements , you need to find the sum all sub arrays of array A. Since the sum could be very large print the sum modulo **(10^9+7)**.

**Example 1:**  
`Input: N = 3 and A[] = {1, 2, 3}`  
`Output: 20`  
**Explanation:**  
`All subarrays are [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [2,3], [1,2,3]. Thus total sum is 20.`

**Example 2:**  
`Input: N = 2 and A[] = {1, 3}`  
`Output: 8`

**Your Task:**  
`You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function subarraySum() which takes the array A[] and its size N as inputs and returns the sum.`

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N)  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

**Constraints:**

- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ A[] ≤ 10^9

**Statistics**

1. Time complexity - O(N)
2. Space complexity - O(1)

**Result**:
