There are N boys and M girls attending a class.

The teacher needs to choose a group containing exactly X students containing no less than 4 boys and no less than one girl for an project.

How many ways are there to choose a group?

**Input Format**  
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

For each test case contains three numbers N,M and X.

**Output Format**  
For each test case, print the number of ways to form a group on separate line.

**Constraints**

- 1≤T≤10^5
- 4≤N≤30
- 1≤M≤30
- 5≤X≤N+M

**Example 1:**  
`Input: 1`  
 `5 2 5`  
`Output: 10`

**Statistics**

1. Time complexity - O(3600) ~ O(1)
2. Space complexity - O(1)

**Result**:
