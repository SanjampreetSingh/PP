# [238] Product of Array Except Self

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

**Example 1:**  
`Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]`  
`[24,12,8,6]`

**Example 2:**  
`Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]`  
`Output: [0,0,9,0,0]`

**Constraints:**

- 2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- 30 <= nums[i] <= 30
- The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

**Follow up:** Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

**Statistics**

1. Time complexity - O(n)
2. Space complexity - O(n)

**Result**:
